# Hierarchical Algorithmic Approach: Island Perimeter Problem

## I. Problem Analysis
1. Understand the problem statement
   - Identify the input: 2D grid of 0s and 1s
   - Identify the output: Perimeter of the island (integer)
   - Recognize constraints: Single island, no holes

2. Visualize the problem
   - Draw simple examples of islands
   - Identify how perimeter is formed

3. Break down the problem
   - Recognize that perimeter is formed by land cells adjacent to water or grid edge
   - Understand that each such adjacency contributes 1 to the perimeter

## II. Algorithm Design
1. Choose a high-level approach
   - Decide between:
     
     a. Counting land cells and subtracting shared edges
     
     b. Iterating through all cells and checking neighbors

2. Outline the main steps
   - Initialize perimeter counter
   - Traverse the grid
   - Check each cell's contribution to perimeter
   - Sum up the contributions

3. Design helper functions (if needed)
   - Function to check if a cell is valid (within grid)
   - Function to count valid neighbors

## III. Data Structure Selection
1. Choose primary data structure
   - 2D list (given in the problem)

2. Consider additional data structures
   - Decide if any additional structures are needed for efficiency

## IV. Implementation Planning
1. Plan the main function
   - Define input parameters
   - Outline the function structure

2. Plan helper functions
   - Define input and output for each helper function
   - Outline the logic for each helper function

3. Determine variable needs
   - Identify necessary variables (e.g., perimeter counter, grid dimensions)

## V. Coding Strategy
1. Start with function signatures
   - Write function definitions with parameters

2. Implement core logic
   - Begin with the main traversal loop
   - Implement cell checking logic

3. Develop helper functions
   - Code functions for checking validity and counting neighbors

4. Handle edge cases
   - Ensure grid edges are properly handled

## VI. Testing and Debugging
1. Develop test cases
   - Create small, manageable test grids
   - Include edge cases (e.g., island touching grid border)

2. Implement testing
   - Write code to run and verify test cases

3. Debug and refine
   - Use print statements or debugger to track issues
   - Refine algorithm based on test results

## VII. Optimization
1. Analyze time complexity
   - Determine the Big O notation of your solution

2. Identify potential optimizations
   - Look for redundant calculations or checks

3. Refactor if necessary
   - Implement optimizations without compromising readability

## VIII. Documentation and Reflection
1. Add comments
   - Explain complex parts of your code

2. Write a brief explanation
   - Summarize your approach and any key decisions

3. Reflect on the process
   - Consider what you learned and how you might approach similar problems in the future
